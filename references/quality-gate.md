# Quality Gate

Run every gate before handoff. A report written by the agent is not proof; generate reports with the bundled scripts.

## Gate order

1. `validate_diagram_manifest.py diagram_manifest.yaml --root <pack-root>`
2. `validate_diagram_lock.py diagram_lock.yaml`
3. `validate_semantic_source.py diagram_lock.yaml source.*`
4. Render semantic.svg and write render_report.json.
5. Create visual.svg after the semantic gate passes.
6. `validate_visual_svg.py diagram_lock.yaml visual.svg --semantic-svg semantic.svg`
7. `render_preview.py diagram_lock.yaml visual.svg preview.png --report preview_render_report.json`
8. Inspect `preview.png` at 100%, revise until the technical visual review passes, and write `preview_review.yaml`.
9. `validate_preview_review.py preview.png preview_review.yaml`
10. If `raster_delivery` is declared, `render_delivery_raster.py diagram_lock.yaml visual.svg delivery.png --report delivery_render_report.json`.
11. `build_check_report.py <diagram-directory>`
12. `build_pack_report.py <pack-root>` only after every generated diagram passes.
13. Optionally run `build_embed_blocks.py <pack-root>` when a publication adapter is requested.

## Lock checks

- Diagram type exists in `diagram_profiles.yaml`.
- Source format is allowed by the type profile.
- A non-preferred renderer has a source-grounded `renderer_reason`.
- Enhancement level meets the type minimum.
- Type-specific semantic sections exist and are internally valid.
- Type-native semantic grammar passes: process/data-object separation, decision/merge topology, standard state pseudo-states, contiguous sequence order and density mitigation, and explicit loop feedback.
- Fixed canvas dimensions and viewBox agree; auto canvas bounds are valid.
- Delivery target defines the actual embedding viewport and legibility thresholds.
- Contract v4 defines pack visual behavior separately from palette, typography, stroke language, and texture; resolved style tokens exactly match the pack identity.
- Layout selection has a source-grounded reason after Pick/Skip/Alternative evaluation.
- Contract v3 locks declare viewpoint, reading question, notation profile, and valid notation roles.
- Layout-specific notation signatures exist, such as a decision in a branching flow or a boundary in a layered architecture.

## Manifest checks

- Required pack metadata and diagram entries exist.
- Diagram ids are unique and statuses are valid.
- Generated entries declare renderer and enhancement level allowed by their type profile.
- Skipped and needs_clarification entries name the missing facts.
- Generated entry id, type, renderer, style, and enhancement level match diagram_lock.yaml.
- Generated entry layout pattern matches diagram_lock.yaml.
- Contract v3 generated entries declare distinct reading questions and compatible viewpoint/notation profiles.
- Repeated pack viewpoints or visual signatures have a source-grounded diversity reason only when no fact-complete alternative exists.
- Every generated v4 diagram declares a renderer family equal to its technical type and a per-diagram treatment.

## Semantic checks

- Every locked semantic item has a stable source identity.
- Every locked label is present.
- Endpoints and memberships reference existing semantic ids.
- Sequence order, ER fields/keys/cardinalities, state transitions, and swimlane ownership pass their type rules.
- Sequence call/return kinds and phase fragments remain source-grounded; high-density scenarios cannot pass as one ungrouped message wall.

## Visual checks

- SVG parses and its canvas follows the lock.
- Required labels remain visible.
- Colors and fonts come from style_tokens.
- SVG root identity metadata and actual stroke widths/caps/joins match the v4+ pack identity.
- Contract v5 semantic groups carry the computed visual tiers; focal emphasis and composition-span checks pass.
- Every visible text element declares a locked `data-text-role` and uses that role's exact size.
- No text falls below the minimum effective font size after scaling into the delivery viewport.
- Every semantic id is present exactly once through stable metadata or a supported renderer id.
- Edge endpoints and group/lane memberships match the lock.
- Every locked notation role matches `data-notation-role` and a permitted real SVG shape.
- Decisions, lifelines, datastores, terminals, boundaries, lanes, and state markers cannot be replaced by generic rectangles.
- Flow data objects render as note/data-object geometry, state initial/final markers use standard pseudo-state geometry, and sequence returns use dashed connectors while calls remain solid.
- No unlisted semantic identity is introduced.
- Medium and strong enhancement are not geometry-identical to semantic.svg.
- Every non-container semantic item is covered by the layout plan and every edge has one visual role.
- Selected layout complexity limits are not exceeded without explicit user approval.
- Analyzable edge coverage meets the selected layout threshold.
- Edge crossings, edge-to-nonendpoint-node intersections, and long routes stay within the selected layout limits.
- Contract v5 route economy still checks endpoint alignment, bend counts, routing family, and actual/direct detour ratios. Contract v6 first enforces `layout_plan.routing_plan`: every edge belongs to one type-native group, independent direct routes stay below the layout threshold, grouped axes share real corridors, and loop orbits have visible curvature. Declared spines, buses, rails, ports, orbits, and feedback paths may outrank a local chord but remain subject to total-route limits.
- Edge labels meet `style_tokens.typography.edge_label_size`, not only the global minimum.
- Text stays inside its owning geometry with locked delivery padding.
- Text and nodes do not overlap or leave the canvas.
- Edge labels do not overlap nodes and remain unambiguously anchored to their own route.
- Text contrast meets the delivery target ratio.
- Measurable text coverage meets the delivery target threshold.

## Preview checks

- `preview.png` exists and is rendered from the passed `visual.svg`.
- PNG dimensions exactly match `delivery_target`; derive height from viewBox when omitted.
- `build_check_report.py` validates the PNG independently of the renderer report.
- `preview_review.yaml` matches the current PNG and visual SVG hashes and every technical visual review check passes.
- When `raster_delivery` is declared, the font stack resolves to a declared non-generic family, `delivery.png` dimensions equal the logical target dimensions multiplied by `pixel_ratio`, and `delivery_render_report.json` binds it to the current `visual.svg`; it is not used as the target-size review artifact.

## Generalization checks

- Reusable profiles, layouts, notation rules, renderers, and validators are publishing-platform independent.
- A reusable fix is stated as a technical invariant over diagram type, notation role, topology, layout, geometry, typography, or generic delivery constraints.
- Regression fixtures use domain-neutral labels and ids and prove the invariant without depending on one generated pack.
- No reusable code or template matches a project name, page title, business field, semantic item id, known SVG path string, or fixed coordinates from one output.
- Case-specific repairs remain in that pack's lock, source, or visual artifact and are regenerated through the normal pipeline rather than applied as post-render substitutions.

## Failure handling

| Failure | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Missing source facts | Mark skipped or needs_clarification in manifest |
| Invalid profile, routing, or lock | Stop before semantic source generation |
| Repeated viewpoint or visual signature | Select a fact-complete alternate view, split companion views, or record why repetition is unavoidable |
| Three or more technical types collapse into one rounded-card signature | Use type-native renderers; use `visual_diversity_reason` only when the source truly prevents a distinct technical treatment |
| Notation role or geometry mismatch | Use the selected technical symbol; metadata-only relabeling is not a fix |
| Type-native semantic grammar failure | Reclassify the semantic item, repair topology, add source-grounded sequence fragments, or split the diagram; do not silence the rule with styling |
| Semantic mismatch | Fail semantic gate; do not render |
| Renderer unavailable | Write render_unavailable and a failed check report |
| Visual semantic drift | Write visual_failed; keep semantic artifacts |
| Visual no-op at medium/strong | Fail visual gate and perform the required visual work |
| Text overflow or undersized delivery text | Expand/reflow geometry, reroute downstream edges, or split the diagram |
| Clear same-axis edge takes an unnecessary dogleg | Replace it with the direct segment; retain bends only for off-axis type-native routing, detected obstacles, backward feedback, or control rails |
| Layered or boundary-heavy view becomes a diagonal web | Restore a minimal orthogonal spine with explicit ports; keep diagonals for decision/merge or declared radial/loop layouts |
| Diagram passes per-edge checks but still reads as independent wires | Rebuild `routing_plan` around a shared spine, bus, rail, port set, message grid, lifecycle axis, spoke set, or orbit; do not relabel unrelated direct edges as a group |
| Loop edges are technically curved but visually remain chords | Increase orbit curvature and place nodes around a perimeter until the orbit detour metric and target-size review both pass |
| Missing or wrong-size preview | Render `preview.png` at the locked delivery target and rebuild reports |
| Missing or wrong-size raster delivery | Render `delivery.png` from `visual.svg` at the declared `pixel_ratio`; keep `preview.png` unchanged |
| Raster font resolves to an undeclared fallback | Install a declared family or update the style font stack, then rerender; do not sharpen the bitmap |
| Stale or failed technical review | Inspect the current preview, revise the SVG, rerender, and rebind the review hash |
| Pack contains a failed diagram | Fail diagram_pack_report; do not present the pack as passed |
| Proposed fix only works for one page, project, label, id, path, or coordinate set | Reject it as a reusable skill change; express a domain-neutral invariant or keep the repair inside the generated pack |
| Publishing destination starts changing technical semantics or layout grammar | Remove the destination branch; retain only generic viewport, format, background, or pixel-density constraints |
